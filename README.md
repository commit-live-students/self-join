# SELF JOINS

The SQL SELF JOIN is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables; temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

### Syntax

        SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name...
        FROM table1 a, table1 b
        WHERE a.common_field = b.common_field;

Here, the WHERE clause could be any given expression based on your requirement.

Now, let us join Customers table using SELF JOIN as follows âˆ’

        SELECT  a.CustomerID, b.CustomerName
           FROM Customers a, Customers b
           WHERE a.CustomerID = b.CustomerID;
